## 💻 Software & Game Developer

Hi, I'm Mert!

🎓 Studied Computer Engineering at the Kocaeli University, Turkey. 
🎯 These days, I'm learning and working on both **web development** (with ASP.NET Core) and **game development** (using Unity). 
🎮 I love playing video games in my spare time, especially ""Souls-like** games - I enjoy the challenge and dark fantasy atmosphere!
