## 💻 Software & Game Developer

Hi, I'm Mert!

🎓 Studied Computer Engineering at the Kocaeli University, Turkey. <br/>
🎯 These days, I'm learning and working on both **web development** (with ASP.NET Core) and **game development** (using Unity). <br/>
🎮 I love playing video games in my spare time, especially **Souls-like** games - I enjoy the challenge and dark fantasy atmosphere!<br/>
